# My notes from a PhD course in Numerical Methods 
Contains the codes from my exam in the PhD course [DRE4017 - Numerical Methods in Finance and Economics](https://programmeinfo.bi.no/nb/course/DRE-4017/2019-autumn)
 at BI Norwegian Business School

## My exam assignment:
Firstly, read the paper ["Higher Order Effects in Asset Pricing Models with Long‚ÄêRun Risks"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.12615) by Walter Pohl, Karl Schmedders and Ole Wilms (2018).

Secondly, I chose two of the models they look at in the paper:
I)  ["Risks for the long run: A potential resolution of asset pricing
puzzles"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00670.x) by Bansal, Ravi, and Amir Yaron (2004).
II) ["An empirical evaluation of the long-run risks
model for asset prices"](https://www.nber.org/papers/w15504) by Bansal, Ravi, Dana Kiku, and Amir Yaron (2012).

Thirdly, and then my assigment is to reproduce the results from Pohl, Schmedders and Wilms (2018) for these two paper by taking their code in MATLAB and translate into Python.
